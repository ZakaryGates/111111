# Blockly Block Wiki

Blockly has a large number of blocks.  They are divided into the following categories:

  * [Logic](Logic) (including [If/Else](IfElse))
  * [Loops](Loops)
  * Math
  * [Text](Text)
  * [Lists](Lists)
  * [Colour](Colour)
  * [Variables](Variables)
  * Functions

A Blockly application will choose which (if any) of these default blocks are present.
Additionally, most applications will also create their own custom blocks.
