# FAQs for Blockly Users

**What is Blockly?**

A new programming language made up of "blocks" that look like jigsaw puzzle pieces.


**What do I use Blockly for?**

First, a programmer needs to integrate Blockly with a web application, like Gmail or Google Docs, that you already use. Then you can use Blockly to write simple programs like macros and scripts that work with the web application.

For example, in Gmail, you can use Blockly to create email filters that do things like, "If Bob emails me three times in less than an hour, and each email contains the word 'deadline', delete all his emails except the first one."


**How do I write a program with Blockly?**

You click a block to place it in your workspace, then right-click the block to select the options you want, and then drag and drop blocks together to make a program.


**The program I wrote doesn't make any sense!**

Blockly lets you put together blocks almost any way you want - even if your program won't work. Blockly keeps you from making some kinds of mistakes, like programming syntax errors, but it can't prevent you from making mistakes like telling a program to, "Divide 'hello' by seven."

If you know the basics of software programming, you can use Blockly to write useful programs that do cool things. And if you don't know how to program, playing around with Blockly can help you learn.
