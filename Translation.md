# Introduction

Our goal is for Blockly to be available in as many languages as possible, so students don't have to struggle with English at the same time as they're learning computer science concepts.


# Using Blockly

If you're not already a Blockly user, try it out.  Some good starting places are:
  * [Puzzle](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/blockly/apps/puzzle/index.html) (to learn the Blockly user interface)
  * [Maze](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/blockly/apps/maze/index.html)
  * [Code](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/blockly/apps/code/index.html) (meant for experienced programmers)

# Translatewiki

All of Blockly's translations are handled by [translatewiki.net](http://translatewiki.net).

## Creating an account at Translatewiki

Use the [Getting started wizard](http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Special%3AFirstSteps&type=signup).  Steps are:
  1. Creating an account.
  1. Configuring your preferences.  You may specify any languages at this step.
  1. Creating your user page.  You must specify (at least) "I have a moderate command of" "English" to do translations for Blockly.  You should also specify at least one other language that you are able to do translations into.
  1. Request translator permissions.  Write a brief introduction, ideally information to give the reviewer reason to believe you're a genuine translator and not a vandal.  For example, if you have already contributed translations to Blockly, link to the translated file and point out that it contains your name (assuming it does).  Here are the [maze translations](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fapps%2Fmaze).  Press "Send request".  You then need to wait to be manually approved, which can take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours (longest during nighttime in Central Europe).  **You probably will not be notified that you were approved; just give it a try a little later.**

Optionally, personalize your user page.  You can do this by clicking on your user name, which is shown on the top of the page once you have logged in.  Once on your user page, the easiest way to modify it is by clicking on the "Edit with form" tab near the top of the page.
